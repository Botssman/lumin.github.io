With at-home and on-site power now more important than ever, many new products of 2020 aimed to make solar installations quicker and the user experience simpler for easier solar power consumption.<br><br>There weren\u2019t any in-person tradeshows for SPW editors to attend and see new products, but we kept an eye on everything happening in every corner of the market this year. These are our top choices for the most innovative products announced and coming available soon. We expect these products to transform the solar installation market \u2014 all for the better.<br><br>Be sure to check out an even more extensive database of this year\u2019s Top Products here."},{"image":"\/lumin-article\/64674909961d6e6f9731ea1f_image2057.png","text_|_raw":"When it comes to solar and energy storage, descriptive words can sometimes be confusing. A common misconception about battery backup is that the battery will actually back-up the entirety of a home\u2019s loads.

If a battery is low on power, fully charging an electric vehicle probably isn\u2019t of the highest priority. Instead, apps like Lumin\u2019s can monitor energy consumption and automatically shed large loads during an outage to protect the battery from draining. Smart panels and smart circuits give consumers the flexibility to back-up everything or just a few important loads \u2014 and on varying schedules. The whole house might not be humming at full power during an outage, but at least homeowners don\u2019t have to settle for a few circuits every time a grid interruption occurs."},{"text_|_raw":"When it comes to solar and energy storage, descriptive words can sometimes be confusing.
