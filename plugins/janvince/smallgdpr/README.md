## Settings

### Tab: Cookies groups

The main idea is to create groups of cookies with JS scripts that you want to run on your website.

#### Required 

When turned on users cannot disable these groups in Manage cookies component and scripts will be always executed.

#### Default enabled

Scripts in these groups will run without explicit user concent but can be disabled by user (in Manage cookies component).

Be careful not to violate your local laws!

#### Default checked

Scripts in these groups will not run but in modal window they will be pre-checked.

#### Scripts

You can add one or more scripts to selected group

##### Custom JS code or files

You can add your own JS code and/or files to be executed when a cookies group is allowed (or required).

You can optionally limit scripts execution to production mode.

##### Run only in production

Script wil be executed only in `production` environment.

##### Disable

This scripts will never be executed

##### Run on specific pages

You can limit scripts execution to specific pages URLs.

### Tab: Cookies bar 

You can edit title and content of cookies bar.

If you want, you can select from pre-defined CSS styles.

#### Buttons

You can add one or more buttons to your cookies bar. 

##### Allow all cookies

When turned on, click on this button will set all cookies groups enabled.

Usefull for "Allow all" button on Cookies bar.

*Note: Users can change cookies settings later on CMS page with Manage cookies component (like /gdpr) if you create one.*

##### Open modal window

When turned on, click on this button open modal window with list of cookies group.

*Currently supported only for Boostrap 3 UI style (can be set on tab Settings).*

### Tab: Manage cookies

Just add title and content and those will be shown above cookies groups listing in Manage cookies component.


### Tab: Settings

Few general settings to be set.

#### Cookies expiration

Number of days for cookies to live in browser.

#### UI style

Change formating of output HTML code.

#### Set cookies for each language

> Default is on.

This is required if you use Rainlab Translate plugin and you set up cookies groups for each language with different cookies groups codes.

On the other hand if you have separate languages but same cookies groups codes and you want your visitors not to have consent for each language separately, you can switch this off.

### Tab: Import

You can import settings presets from Media your own path or default plugin preset (if you leave all empty).

You have to use YAML format.

*Note: Try Export first to get idea of an import file structure.*

### Tab: Export

You can export current settings data to configuration file and use it as a backup or template for other sites.



## Components

### Cookies bar

Should be used in your Layouts or Pages.

#### Hide Cookies bar

If you need to hide Cookies bar on specific Page or Layout, you can use [View Bag](https://octobercms.com/docs/cms/components#viewbag-component) on your Page this way:

```
[viewBag]
hideCookiesBar = 1
```

### Manage cookies

Put this component to your page with details about privacy (like /gdpr or /cookies).

> Manage cookies component can be also added as a snippet to Static Page

Users will be able to change cookies settings.

## HOWTO

With component `Cookies bar` or `Manage cookies` you can access cookies settings in your Twig code like this:

```
{% if sgCookies.necessary %}
 ...
{% endif %}
```
